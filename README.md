Whydah
=======================================

Whydah is a toy programming language I created as a platform for experimentation with language design and implementation. In its current form, it's dynamically-typed, object-oriented, and interpreted, but a lot of the details (and even some of the most fundamental principles) are subject to sudden and extensive change.

One of my goals with Whydah is minimalism. I'm deliberately keeping the language's syntax and core concepts as simple and transparent as possible, preferring (wherever possible) to implement functionality as part of the language's standard library rather than as a built-in construct of the language itself. As such, things as seemingly "low-level" as if/then/else conditions and while loops are themselves written in Whydah alone.

A lot of my inspiration comes from [Magpie](http://github.com/munificent/magpie) and [Finch](http://github.com/munificent/finch). Both of these languages were developed by the [same guy](http://github.com/munificent), whose tradition of naming programming languages after types of birds I have shamelessly ripped off. Go check out his stuff, it's way more interesting than mine. Also take a look at [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), another major source of inspiration and one of the neatest emerging languages I've seen.
